is used for easy arithmetic being able to convert positive to negative. 
You convert the positive to negative by changing the most significant bitn (MSB) to a 1 this gets read as negative then. All of the other bits are then positive so are added up to make the negative number. 
If you want the number to be even then you change the least significant bit (LSB) to a 1.
